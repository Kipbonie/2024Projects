ABSTRACT

E-governance is the use of information and communication technology (ICT) to deliver government services, exchange information, and support decision-making. Compliance monitoring is the process of ensuring that an organization is meeting its regulatory obligations. E-governance can be used to improve compliance monitoring in a number of ways. For example, it can be used to automate compliance monitoring tasks, provide real-time visibility into compliance performance, and facilitate communication and collaboration between different departments and stakeholders involved in compliance monitoring. This project will explore the relationship between e-governance and compliance monitoring in more detail. The major challenge in this project is to ensure that e-governance is used to improve compliance monitoring in a way that is both efficient, effective, and secure and the project will also identify the challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully realize the benefits of e-governance for compliance monitoring in various sectors i.e., financial sector. The project will also draw on secondary data, such as government reports and academic research. The findings of the project will be disseminated through a final report, presentations at academic conferences, and publications in academic journals.

Keywords: e-governance, compliance monitoring, financial sector, automation, real-time visibility, communication, collaboration.
